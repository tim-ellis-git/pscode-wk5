// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

set number 1 as variable x
set number 2 as variable y
do arithmetic
	set z = x+y
print z to screen or output 

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

set number 1 as variable x 
do arithmetic
	if x modulus 2 = 0 print "number 1 is even" 
	else if x modulus 2 does not equal 0 print "number 1 is odd" 
	else print "something went wrong here" 

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

get the 5 numbers input as different variables 
	set number 1 = a
	set number 2 = b
	set number 3 = c
	set number 4 = d
	set number 5 = e

make a list variable of the the input numbers 
	set list = [a b c d e] as an array (this will be in the order entered)
		

do the arithmetic 
	set sum = sum function (a through e) or a+b+c+d+e
	do sum divided by number of input numbers (could do a count function for scale, or just sum/5)
		set avg = sum/5
			
use the list variable to get the min and max values 
	set mininum = min(list) -- shouldn't need to sort but may be necessary, most things have a min(array) function
	set maximum = max(list)

print results 
	"the entered numbers are:" a b c d e 
	"their average is:" avg
	"the minimum value is:" min
	"the maximum value is:" max
